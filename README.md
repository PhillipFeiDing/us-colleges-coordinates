# About the dataset
The dataset is partially generated by ChatGPT, so we cannot guarantee every single entry is correct. I welcome everyone interested to submit pull request to correct inaccurate entries. Please star this repository if you find this dataset helpful! There is also no restrictions to use this dataset in your project (which is created by myself). The original list of universities/colleges is found here: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuyuGT/CS7450-data/main/colleges.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuyuGT/CS7450-data/main/colleges.csv).
