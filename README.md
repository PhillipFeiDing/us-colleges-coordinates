# us-colleges-coordinates
A dataset for the geographical coordinates of 2000+ US colleges and universities

# About the dataset
The dataset is partially generated by ChatGPT, so as a disclaimer, we cannot guarantee every single entry is accurate.

How I did this: I asked 20 colleges in a batched query, and ChatGPT responded to me the coordinates in a list format. I did some post-data processing to format the entire dataset to CSV file. It turns out ChatGPT is quite accurate about the vast majority of the coordinates, and for those ambiguous ones, it would even honestly state it doesn't know, so that's why I also needed to manually google search a few schools by myself.

I welcome everyone interested to submit pull request to correct inaccurate entries. Besides all the concern with misinformation, there is no restrictions to use this dataset in your work on my end.
